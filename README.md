## Docker

Docker is used to manage the development environment and to emulate services.

To connect to your Docker development server:

1. Start the container in detached mode with `docker compose up -d <service_name>`
2. Enter the container with `docker compose exec <service_name> bash`

If you suspect a build is outdated:

1. Rebuild the container with `docker compose build --no-cache <service_name>`

## Poetry

Poetry is used to manage the Python environment in the development container. Poetry commands should generally be run on the development server.

- Show what is installed with `poetry show`
- Add a new library with `poetry add <library_name>@<version>`
- Remove an existing library with `poetry remove <library_name>`
- Reinstall requirements by rebuilding the development container
